Welcome to the Cyberloafing Toolkit. This repository contains loafing tools and scripts designed to help people working from home / on-site.

### Firefox via Phone Hotspot
**Location:** `Firefox using your phone hotspot/`

This module details how to force a specific instance of Firefox to route its internet traffic through a secondary network adapter (such as a **USB tethered/WiFi mobile hotspot**) using **ForceBindIP**. This ensures that your browsing activity bypasses the default system network connection.

For detailed setup instructions, please refer to Instruction.md.

### Make Teams Green

This script is used to keep your Microsoft Teams status as "Available" (Green), preventing it from timing out to "Away" status due to inactivity.

### Toggle Window on Top

This tool allows you to make a specific window stay on the top layer (Always on Top). You can then drag loafing websites or personal content underneath that window, keeping them hidden while a work-related window remains visible in the foreground.
